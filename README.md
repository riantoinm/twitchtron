## Dependencies
Streams can be watched in app and using PiP without the need for any additional software. On the other hand, watching streams
in VLC requires 2 pieces of software:

* [Streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/) (an updated version of Livestreamer)

Both VLC Media Player and Streamlink are free and open source!
